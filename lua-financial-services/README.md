## Compliance & Security

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important: This is a demonstration implementation**

For production deployment, you MUST:

- ‚úÖ Implement proper encryption for PII (AES-256, KMS)
- ‚úÖ Follow KYC/AML regulations (Bank Secrecy Act, Patriot Act)
- ‚úÖ Maintain audit logs of all data access
- ‚úÖ Use HTTPS only
- ‚úÖ Implement data retention policies
- ‚úÖ Follow GDPR/CCPA for data privacy
- ‚úÖ Store documents in compliant storage (encrypted at rest)
- ‚úÖ Conduct regular security audits
- ‚úÖ Implement fraud detection
- ‚úÖ Follow FinCEN guidelines

### Security Example

```typescript
// In production, use proper encryption
import crypto from 'crypto';

function encryptPII(data: string): string {
  const algorithm = 'aes-256-gcm';
  const key = Buffer.from(env('ENCRYPTION_KEY'), 'hex');
  const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);
  
  const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);
  let encrypted = cipher.update(data, 'utf8', 'hex');
  encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
  
  const authTag = cipher.getAuthTag();
  
  return JSON.stringify({
    encrypted,
    iv: iv.toString('hex'),
    authTag: authTag.toString('hex')
  });
}
```

## Alternative Verification Services

This demo uses Stripe Identity, but you can integrate with:

**Onfido**
```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://api.onfido.com/v3/applicants', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Token token=${env('ONFIDO_API_KEY')}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    first_name: input.firstName,
    last_name: input.lastName,
    email: input.email
  })
});
```

**Jumio**
```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://netverify.com/api/v4/initiate', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${env('JUMIO_API_TOKEN')}`
  }
});
```

**Plaid Identity**
```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://production.plaid.com/identity/get', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    client_id: env('PLAID_CLIENT_ID'),
    secret: env('PLAID_SECRET'),
    access_token: userAccessToken
  })
});
```

## Customization

### Add Selfie Verification

```typescript
export class CaptureSelfie Tool implements LuaTool {
  name = "capture_selfie";
  description = "Capture selfie for facial verification";
  
  inputSchema = z.object({
    applicationId: z.string(),
    selfieUrl: z.string().url()
  });

  async execute(input: z.infer<typeof this.inputSchema>) {
    const app = await Data.getEntry('onboarding_applications', input.applicationId);
    
    await Data.update('onboarding_applications', input.applicationId, {
      ...app.data,
      selfie: {
        url: input.selfieUrl,
        capturedAt: new Date().toISOString()
      }
    });
    
    return {
      success: true,
      message: "Selfie captured. Comparing with ID photo..."
    };
  }
}
```

### Add Fraud Detection

```typescript
// Check for suspicious activity
const fraudCheck = await fetch('https://fraud-api.com/check', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: app.data.email,
    ip_address: userIp,
    device_fingerprint: deviceId
  })
});

const fraudResult = await fraudCheck.json();

if (fraudResult.risk_score > 0.7) {
  await Data.update(applicationId, {
    ...app.data,
    status: 'fraud_review',
    flaggedForReview: true,
    flagReason: 'High fraud risk score'
  });
}
```

## Production Considerations

### Data Retention
- Keep applications for 7 years (regulatory requirement)
- Implement automated data deletion for rejected applications
- Archive completed applications to cold storage

### Audit Logging
```typescript
await Data.create('audit_logs', {
  action: 'document_uploaded',
  applicationId: input.applicationId,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  ipAddress: userIp,
  userAgent: userAgent
});
```

### Compliance Monitoring
- Regular review of declined applications
- Monthly compliance reports
- Suspicious activity reporting (SAR)
- Customer due diligence (CDD)

## How It Works

1. **Application State Management**: Each application is stored in Lua Data with current step tracking
2. **Document Verification**: Documents are uploaded and verified through Stripe Identity
3. **Risk Scoring**: Automated suitability scoring based on financial profile
4. **Secure Storage**: PII is encrypted before storage
5. **Workflow Tracking**: Each step is validated before proceeding to next
6. **Account Creation**: Final account is created after all verifications pass
